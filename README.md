## Hello there, I'm Thomas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product developer and software engineer and I've been building things since 2008. I love [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) and coffee.

I founded [codeBOX](https://github.com/gocodebox) in 2012 and served as a product owner and lead developer of [LifterLMS](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms) until 2022.
